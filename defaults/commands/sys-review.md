description: Run verification before completing work
---

Use the systematic:verification-before-completion skill to verify all work is complete.

Run all relevant verification commands:
1. Run tests
2. Run build
3. Run linting
4. Check for uncommitted changes
5. Verify requirements are met

Report evidence for each check, not assumptions.
