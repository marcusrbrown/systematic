This guide is designed for AI agents and automated systems to install and verify the Systematic plugin for OpenCode. It uses clear, imperative language and explicit verification steps.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following environment requirements are met:

- **OpenCode** is installed and configured.
- **Node.js 18+** or the **Bun** runtime is available in the path.

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to enable Systematic in your environment:

<Steps>
1. **Add plugin to configuration**
   Append `@fro.bot/systematic@latest` to the `plugins` array in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`.

   ```json
   {
     "plugins": ["@fro.bot/systematic@latest"]
   }
   ```

2. **Restart OpenCode**
   Restart the OpenCode session to trigger the `config` hook, which automatically discovers and registers all bundled assets.

3. **Verify bootstrap loading**
   Run the following command to confirm the plugin is active and teaching your assistant:
   ```bash
   /systematic:using-systematic
   ```
</Steps>

## Verification

Execute these commands to confirm each component of the plugin is correctly registered and functional.

### 1. Skill Verification
Run the bootstrap skill. It should display the "Using Systematic" guide.
```bash
/systematic:using-systematic
```

### 2. Agent Verification
Mention a specialized agent. The assistant should respond with the persona and expertise of the architecture strategist.
```text
@architecture-strategist what is the role of the config hook?
```

### 3. Workflow Verification
Run a workflow command. It should initiate the planning phase.
```bash
/workflows:plan
```

## What to Do Next

Once installation is verified, proceed with these next actions:

- **Read the Philosophy Guide**: Understand the core principles of disciplined engineering at `/systematic/guides/philosophy/`.
- **Try the Main Loop**: Learn how to use the full plan-work-review cycle at `/systematic/guides/main-loop/`.
- **Explore Assets**: Browse the [available skills](/systematic/reference/skills/), [agents](/systematic/reference/agents/), and [commands](/systematic/reference/commands/).
