[OCX](https://github.com/kdcokenny/ocx) is a package manager and component registry for AI agents and developer tools. It allows you to install Systematic components—skills, agents, and commands—individually or as themed bundles, without needing the full npm plugin.

While the npm plugin is the recommended way to get the full Systematic experience (including automatic bootstrap injection), OCX provides a lightweight alternative for users who want to cherry-pick specific workflows or use pre-configured profiles.

## Quick Start

To use the Systematic registry with OCX, first add the registry to your local configuration:

```bash
# Add the Systematic registry
ocx registry add https://fro.bot/systematic --name systematic
```

The registry discovery file is located at `https://fro.bot/systematic/.well-known/ocx.json`.

## Installing Components

Once the registry is added, you can install individual components directly into your project's `.opencode/` directory.

### Individual Skills
Install specific workflows as needed:

```bash
# Install the brainstorming skill
ocx add systematic/brainstorming

# Install the frontend design skill
ocx add systematic/frontend-design
```

### Individual Agents
Add specialized subagents to your project:

```bash
# Add the architecture strategist
ocx add systematic/agent-architecture-strategist

# Add the security sentinel
ocx add systematic/agent-security-sentinel
```

### Individual Commands
Install slash-commands for your project:

```bash
# Add the brainstorming workflow command
ocx add systematic/cmd-brainstorm

# Add the plan workflow command
ocx add systematic/cmd-plan
```

## Bundles

Bundles allow you to install entire categories of Systematic assets in one command:

```bash
# Install all 11 Systematic skills
ocx add systematic/skills

# Install all 24 Systematic agents
ocx add systematic/agents

# Install all 9 Systematic commands
ocx add systematic/commands
```

## Using Profiles

Profiles provide a complete, "opinionated" configuration for Systematic. They can be installed as standalone projects or merged into existing ones.

### Standalone Profile
The `standalone` profile provides a minimal Systematic setup with only the `@fro.bot/systematic` plugin and all bundled assets.

```bash
ocx profile add sys --from systematic/standalone
```

### OMO Profile
The `omo` profile harmonizes Systematic with [Oh My OpenCode (OMO)](https://github.com/marcusrbrown/oh-my-opencode). It configures both plugins to work together, disabling redundant OMO features in favor of Systematic's structured workflows.

```bash
ocx profile add omo-sys --from systematic/omo
```

## npm vs OCX Comparison

| Feature | npm Plugin | OCX Components |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Installation** | Global/Project Plugin | Project-local Components |
| **Updates** | `npm update` | `ocx update` |
| **Discovery** | Automatic (via hooks) | Manual `ocx add` |
| **Bootstrap** | Yes (automatic) | No (manual reference) |
| **Footprint** | Full package | Cherry-picked files |

## Dual Installation

You can use both the npm plugin and OCX components in the same project. This is often useful if you want the global "Using Systematic" bootstrap injection (provided by the plugin) but want to customize or "pin" specific skills locally using OCX.

OpenCode's resolution logic ensures that project-local files in `.opencode/` (installed via OCX) take precedence over bundled assets provided by the plugin.

## Technical Details

- **Registry URL:** `https://fro.bot/systematic/registry/`
- **Discovery Path:** `/.well-known/ocx.json`
- **Compatibility:** Systematic components are compatible with OpenCode 0.12.0 and later.
