[OCX](https://github.com/kdcokenny/ocx) is a package manager and component registry for AI agents and developer tools. It allows you to install Systematic components—skills, agents, and commands—individually or as themed bundles, without needing the full npm plugin.

While the npm plugin is the recommended way to get the full Systematic experience (including automatic bootstrap injection), OCX provides a lightweight alternative for users who want to cherry-pick specific workflows or use pre-configured profiles.

## Quick Start

To use the Systematic registry with OCX, first add the registry to your local configuration:

```bash
# Add the Systematic registry
ocx registry add https://fro.bot/systematic --name systematic
```

OCX resolves the registry automatically from the URL.

## Installing Components

Once the registry is added, you can install individual components directly into your project's `.opencode/` directory.

### Individual Skills
Install specific workflows as needed:

```bash
# Install the brainstorming skill
ocx add systematic/brainstorming

# Install the frontend design skill
ocx add systematic/frontend-design
```

### Individual Agents
Add specialized subagents to your project:

```bash
# Add the architecture strategist
ocx add systematic/agent-architecture-strategist

# Add the security sentinel
ocx add systematic/agent-security-sentinel
```

### Individual Commands
Install slash-commands for your project:

```bash
# Add the brainstorming workflow command
ocx add systematic/cmd-brainstorm

# Add the plan workflow command
ocx add systematic/cmd-plan
```

## Bundles

Bundles allow you to install entire categories of Systematic assets in one command:

```bash
# Install all 11 Systematic skills
ocx add systematic/skills

# Install all 24 Systematic agents
ocx add systematic/agents

# Install all 9 Systematic commands
ocx add systematic/commands
```

## Using Profiles

Profiles provide a complete, "opinionated" configuration for Systematic. They can be installed as standalone projects or merged into existing ones.

:::caution
Profile installation requires the registry to be configured **globally** (not just in the project). Add the `--global` flag when adding the registry:

```bash
ocx registry add https://fro.bot/systematic --name systematic --global
```
:::

### Standalone Profile
The `standalone` profile provides a minimal Systematic setup with only the `@fro.bot/systematic` plugin and all bundled assets.

```bash
ocx profile add sys --from systematic/standalone
```

### OMO Profile
The `omo` profile harmonizes Systematic with [Oh My OpenCode (OMO)](https://github.com/marcusrbrown/oh-my-opencode). It configures both plugins to work together, disabling redundant OMO features in favor of Systematic's structured workflows.

```bash
ocx profile add omo-sys --from systematic/omo
```

## npm vs OCX Comparison

| Feature | npm Plugin | OCX Components |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Installation** | Global/Project Plugin | Project-local Components |
| **Updates** | `npm update` | `ocx update` |
| **Discovery** | Automatic (via hooks) | Manual `ocx add` |
| **Bootstrap** | Yes (automatic) | No (manual reference) |
| **Footprint** | Full package | Cherry-picked files |

## Dual Installation

You can use both the npm plugin and OCX components in the same project. This is often useful if you want the global "Using Systematic" bootstrap injection (provided by the plugin) but want to customize or "pin" specific skills locally using OCX.

OpenCode's resolution logic ensures that project-local files in `.opencode/` (installed via OCX) take precedence over bundled assets provided by the plugin.

## Updating Components

OCX makes it easy to keep your Systematic components up to date.

### Checking for Updates
To see if a local component differs from the registry version:

```bash
ocx diff systematic/brainstorming
```

### Updating a Single Component
To update a specific component to the latest version:

```bash
ocx update systematic/brainstorming
```

### Updating All Components
To update all Systematic components in your project:

```bash
# Update everything from all registries
ocx update --all

# Or update only components from the systematic registry
ocx update --registry systematic
```

### Pinning Versions
If you need a specific version of a component, you can update to a specific tag:

```bash
ocx update systematic/brainstorming@1.2.0
```

:::note
Plugin updates (the core logic) are managed via `npm` or `bun`, while individual skills and agents are managed via `ocx update`.
:::

## Troubleshooting

Common issues when using the Systematic registry with OCX.

### Registry not found
If OCX cannot find the Systematic registry, verify that it was added correctly:

```bash
ocx registry list
```

You should see `systematic` pointing to `https://fro.bot/systematic`. If not, re-add it:
`ocx registry add https://fro.bot/systematic --name systematic`

### Component conflicts
If you have the npm plugin installed AND have added OCX components, Systematic will use the local files in `.opencode/` first. If you experience unexpected behavior, check for duplicate definitions.

### Profile not working
If a profile installation fails or doesn't seem to apply:
1. Verify the registry is configured **globally**: `ocx registry list --global`
2. If missing, add it: `ocx registry add https://fro.bot/systematic --name systematic --global`
3. Check existing profiles: `ocx profile list`
4. If the profile already exists, remove it first: `ocx profile rm <name>`

### Missing skills after OCX install
Individual skills installed via OCX do not automatically get "bootstrap injection" (the automatic loading of `using-systematic`). To get this feature, you must have the `@fro.bot/systematic` plugin installed in your project or globally.

### Version mismatch
If `ocx diff` shows differences but `ocx update` says you are up to date, the registry version might be slightly behind the latest npm release. Check the registry version in the output of `ocx diff`.

## Technical Details

- **Registry URL:** `https://fro.bot/systematic`
- **Compatibility:** Systematic components are compatible with OpenCode 0.12.0 and later.
