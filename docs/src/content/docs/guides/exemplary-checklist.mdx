Creating a high-quality OpenCode plugin goes beyond just functionality. It requires a commitment to developer experience, transparency, and seamless integration. This guide summarizes best practices derived from benchmark plugins and tracks Systematic's progress.

## Benchmarks

These projects represent the gold standard for OpenCode plugins and served as the inspiration for Systematic's design:

- **[Oh My OpenCode](https://github.com/oh-my-opencode/oh-my-opencode)** — The pioneer of structured engineering workflows.
- **[Superpowers](https://github.com/superpowers-ai/superpowers)** — Specialized skills for advanced reasoning and task execution.
- **[Plannotator](https://github.com/plannotator/plannotator)** — Deep focus on planning and architectural oversight.
- **[micode](https://github.com/micode-ai/micode)** — Lightweight, highly focused utility patterns.

## Best Practices Checklist

An exemplary plugin should strive to meet these criteria:

- [ ] **Agent-first installation documentation** — Instructions designed for AI agents to read and follow.
- [ ] **Progressive disclosure** — Simple onboarding that naturally leads to advanced features.
- [ ] **Trust-building through verification** — Explicit steps to verify installation and functionality.
- [ ] **Flowcharts/diagrams** — Visual aids for complex internal workflows.
- [ ] **Clear install-first CTA** — A prominent call-to-action for getting started quickly.
- [ ] **Exemplary naming conventions** — Clear, predictable names for skills, agents, and commands.
- [ ] **Bootstrap injection** — Zero-config onboarding via automated system prompt updates.
- [ ] **Comprehensive reference** — Full documentation for every bundled asset.
- [ ] **Changelog/release notes** — Transparency regarding updates and improvements.
- [ ] **Contributing guide** — Clear path for community involvement.

## Systematic Status

How Systematic currently aligns with these best practices:

| Practice | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Agent-first install docs | ✅ Done | See [Installation Guide](/systematic/getting-started/installation/) |
| Progressive disclosure | ✅ Done | Landing → Guides → Reference flow |
| Verification steps | ✅ Done | Included in Installation Guide |
| Flowcharts/diagrams | ✅ Done | Mermaid diagrams in Architecture guide |
| Install-first CTA | ✅ Done | Prominent in README and Getting Started |
| Naming conventions | ✅ Done | Consistent `systematic:` prefixing |
| Bootstrap injection | ✅ Done | `using-systematic` skill auto-injected |
| Comprehensive reference | ✅ Done | Generated docs for all assets |
| Changelog/release notes | ❌ Gap | Not yet implemented in docs site |
| Contributing guide | ❌ Gap | Needs to be ported to docs site |

## Known Gaps (Backlog)

While Systematic provides a solid foundation, there are several areas identified for improvement to reach "exemplary" status:

- **Changelog/Release Notes**: Implement a dedicated page for tracking plugin updates.
- **Contributing Guide**: Add a guide for developers wishing to contribute new skills or agents.
- **Visual Screenshots/Demos**: Add images and short videos demonstrating workflows in action.
- **Interactive Playground**: A way to test skills without full installation.
- **Community Links**: Official Discord or forum links for user support and discussion.
- **Video Walkthrough**: A high-level video introduction to the Systematic philosophy.

By addressing these gaps, we continue to evolve Systematic into a benchmark plugin for the OpenCode ecosystem.
