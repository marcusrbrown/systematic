import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Prerequisites

Before installing Systematic, ensure you have the following:

- **OpenCode** installed and configured on your machine.
- **Node.js 18+** or the **Bun** runtime installed.

## Installation

Systematic is distributed as an npm package and integrates directly into OpenCode via its plugin system.

<Steps>
1.  **Add the plugin to your configuration**
    
    Open your global OpenCode configuration file (typically located at `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`) and add `@fro.bot/systematic` to the `plugins` array:

    ```json
    {
      "plugins": ["@fro.bot/systematic@latest"]
    }
    ```

2.  **Restart OpenCode**

    Restart your OpenCode session to load the new plugin. Systematic uses OpenCode's `config` hook to automatically register all bundled skills, agents, and commands.

3.  **Verify Installation**

    In any OpenCode conversation, run the bootstrap skill to verify that the plugin is working:

    ```bash
    /systematic:using-systematic
    ```

    If the skill loads and displays usage instructions, the installation was successful.
</Steps>

## Automatic Asset Discovery

One of the key features of Systematic is that it requires zero manual file copying. When the plugin loads, it automatically:

- Discovers all bundled **skills** and makes them available via the `systematic_skill` tool.
- Registers bundled **agents** so you can @mention them immediately.
- Loads bundled **commands** (slash-invokable shortcuts) into your environment.

## Next Steps

Once you've verified the installation, you can:

- [Configure the plugin](/getting-started/configuration/) to disable specific bundled content.
- Learn how to [create your own skills](/guides/creating-skills/).
- Explore the [architecture](/guides/architecture/) to understand how Systematic works under the hood.
