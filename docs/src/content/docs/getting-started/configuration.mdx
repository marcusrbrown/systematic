Systematic works out of the box with sensible defaults, but it provides several ways to customize its behavior and content.

## Plugin Configuration

You can customize the plugin by creating a configuration file. Systematic looks for configuration in two places:

1.  **Global:** `~/.config/opencode/systematic.json`
2.  **Project-specific:** `.opencode/systematic.json` (takes precedence)

### Disabling Bundled Content

If you want to hide certain bundled skills, agents, or commands, you can list them in the `disabled_*` arrays:

```json
{
  "disabled_skills": ["git-worktree"],
  "disabled_agents": [],
  "disabled_commands": []
}
```

## Project-Specific Content

One of Systematic's most powerful features is the ability to add your own skills, agents, and commands that live alongside (or override) the bundled ones.

Add your content to the `.opencode/` directory in your project:

```
.opencode/
├── skills/
│   └── my-team-workflow/
│       └── SKILL.md
├── agents/
│   └── custom-reviewer.md
└── commands/
    └── deploy.md
```

### Overriding Bundled Content

If you create a project-specific asset with the same name as a bundled one, yours will take precedence. This allows you to customize bundled workflows for your specific project needs without modifying the plugin itself.

## Configuration Priority

Systematic resolves configuration and content in the following order (highest priority first):

1.  **Project-level assets:** Files in `.opencode/`
2.  **Project-level config:** `.opencode/systematic.json`
3.  **User-level assets:** Files in `~/.config/opencode/`
4.  **User-level config:** `~/.config/opencode/systematic.json`
5.  **Bundled assets:** Content shipped with the plugin package

## Advanced Configuration

The Systematic configuration file is parsed as JSONC, meaning you can include comments to document your settings.

```jsonc
{
  // Disable git-worktree as we use a different branching model
  "disabled_skills": ["git-worktree"],
  
  // Custom agents are added in .opencode/agents/
  "disabled_agents": []
}
```
