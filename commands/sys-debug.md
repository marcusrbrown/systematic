description: Debug an issue systematically
---

Use the systematic:systematic-debugging skill to investigate and fix the issue.

Follow the four phases:
1. Root Cause Investigation - understand the problem
2. Pattern Analysis - compare with working examples
3. Hypothesis Testing - test minimal fixes
4. Implementation - create test case and fix

Do not skip phases or guess at fixes.
