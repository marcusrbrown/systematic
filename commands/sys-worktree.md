description: Create an isolated git worktree for feature work
---

Use the systematic:using-git-worktrees skill to create an isolated workspace.

Follow the directory selection process:
1. Check for existing worktree directories
2. Check project config
3. Ask user if needed

Ensure the worktree directory is git-ignored before creating.
