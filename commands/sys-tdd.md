description: Implement a feature using TDD
---

Use the systematic:test-driven-development skill to implement the feature.

Follow the red-green-refactor cycle:
1. Write failing test
2. Watch it fail (verify correct failure)
3. Write minimal code to pass
4. Watch it pass
5. Refactor if needed
6. Repeat

No production code without a failing test first.
